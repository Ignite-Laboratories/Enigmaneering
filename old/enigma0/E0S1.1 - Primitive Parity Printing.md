# `E0S1.1 - Primitive Parity Printing`

### What is this example doing?

Well, simply put: it counts to approximately 20 and tells you the number's parity (_even_ or _odd_).  
In reality, it's doing so much more under the hood to facilitate this.

Let's break it down step by step -

    main() -
	    core.Impulse.Loop(Hold, condition.Always, false)

    ...

    func Hold(ctx core.Context) {
        time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
    }

The first thing you will find is `core.Impulse` - the globally available _impulse engine_ for all
JanOS instances.  For now, we will focus entirely around _this_ impulse engine - but, just be aware
that an instance can have as many impulse engines as it likes.  You are _not_ required to utilize
_only_ the core impulse engine.

The hold function simply sleeps, allowing the impulse engine to keep counting up beats.  Since the impulse 
rate is slow, all neural activation completes before the next impulse - thus, the next beat would always
reset to _0_ without this function.

The rest of the above is quite straightforward - we create a _looping neural activation_ that fires 
the `Hold` function on every impulse.  It accomplishes this through a package called `when` which 
provides some basic helper **Potentials**.  This is one of the most _crucial_ concepts of neural 
execution - _every action fires after testing a potential function._

The final parameter is a boolean that indicates if the neuron should be _muted_ upon creation. I'll
expand more on the function of muting later on, for now let's continue to the next two neurons -

    main() -
        core.Impulse.Stimulate(func(ctx core.Context) {
            PrintParity(ctx, "Even")
        }, when.Beat.Even, false)
    
        core.Impulse.Stimulate(func(ctx core.Context) {
            PrintParity(ctx, "Odd")
        }, when.Beat.Odd, false)

    ...

    func PrintParity(ctx core.Context, parity string) {
        fmt.Printf("%d - %v\n", ctx.Beat, parity)
    }

Here is one of the most powerful ways of creating impulsive stimulations - through inline anonymous
functions!  Here, both neurons are utilizing the same underlying function - `PrintParity` - but each
is uniquely modifying how it invokes it when stimulated.

The next thing you will find is a less common structure called `when.Beat` which provides helper functions
for creating beat oriented potentials.  I say it's less common because _live_ systems typically won't leverage
_beat_ potentials, by design - but _static_ systems will.  We'll talk about _static_ neural activation later.

    tl;dr - anonymous functions can be used to inject information into an activation thread

Let's continue -

    main() - 
        core.Impulse.MaxFrequency = 4.0 //hz

This sets the maximum impulse rate of the engine to `4hz`. The maximum impulse frequency can be used 
to directly slow neural activation _without_ adding temporal weight.  This effectively _limits_ the 
rate of impulse.

If you'd rather add temporal weight, impulse engines also have a `Resistance` value which can _throttle_ 
every impulse.  It's quite primitive in execution, but _very_ effective - it just counts to the resistance
value as a blocking stimulation for every impulse of the engine - 

	main() -
        core.Impulse.Resistance = 800000000

    core.NewEngine() -
        regulator := func(ctx Context) {
            for i := 0; i < engine.Resistance; i++ {
            }
        }
        engine.Block(regulator, when.Always, false)

This method, however, _doesn't_ provide any guarantees of frequency!  Instead, it provides a _control
surface_ through which a system can regulate _itself_.  The concept of _control surfaces_ will
echo a lot as we progress into this project - simply put, they provide mechanisms for intra-activation 
control that are unique to each system.  Since resistance is adjustable, neurons can directly regulate 
impulsivity based around context in an intelligent feedback loop.

It's an _entirely abstract_ concept - one that can be imbued upon anything through using intentional terminology!

    tl;dr - using good terminology empowers the next enigmaneer to instinctively know what something does

Lastly we call the most important method of the entire ecosystem -

    // Make it so
    core.Impulse.Spark()

Simply put, this is what begins neural execution of an impulse engine =)
