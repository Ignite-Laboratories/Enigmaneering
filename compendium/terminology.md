**Diminishment** - Using a less resolute pattern to approximate an index potential.

**Diminishment Interval** - The measured potential of a diminishment index.

**Diminishment Pattern** - Explicitly referencing the ordered bits represented by the interval.

**Scale Tones** - The potentials identified by a diminishment applied to a larger index.

**Binary Overtones** - Basic compositional tones used in the process of approximating a potential.
