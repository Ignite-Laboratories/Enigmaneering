# `Invariants`
### `Alex Petz, Ignite Laboratories, February 2026`

I feel like an imposter writing mathematical axioms because I'm not a mathematician - I'm a software engineer.

Defining some basic "givens" of how I feel the world operates is very helpful to my mental process, though.

### The Continuity Axiom

    " Space doesn't have to be manifold - only experience. "

### The Latency Axiom

    " Response time should be kept minimal to select for healthy instincts. "

### The Attraction Axiom

    " External description of an internalized Platonic Form creates an attraction gradient. "

### The Motivation Axiom

    " An attraction gradient always seeks a dynamic equilibrium, for stable implies perfection. "

### The Awareness Axiom

    " Empathetic equilibriums can only be reached through mutual awareness. "

### The Knowledge Axiom

    " Knowledge can never deteriorate, only the mechanisms for each to access it. "

### The Epiphany Axiom

    " All things are knowable, given enough query time, as knowledge is the act of resolving into an ideal state of mind."

### The Recovery Axiom

    " As all things are knowable, it's the collective responsibility to advocate for the confounded. "

Metaphorically, these invariants fuzzily found the core of distributed mental _"RAID."_

I'm just a guy - I can't answer all of your questions as no engineer is an island. 

But I can give you an empathetic soundboard with which you can echo your ideas back until you've 
answered them through _commiseration_ =)
