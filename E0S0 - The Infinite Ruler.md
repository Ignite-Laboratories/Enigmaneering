# `E2S0 - The Infinite Ruler`

To reveal our creation from the marble, we first need a sense of _scale._

But what does _scale_ even mean?  

What's the modality of creation, as performed in the _Key of Life_?

We'll all call the tune - the piper will play it however they like - _yet we still **recognize** it._

_**How!?**_

This is the foundation of what I refer to as _fidelity space_ - or, the idea that multiple things can be compared with
_**implicit**_ frames of reference. The quality of each rendition is secondary, and subjectively shaped by the observer’s vantage 
point and experience. Ultimately, the most resolute version quietly sets the bar, and every other is understood in relation 
to _that_ indexed scale.

The best way I know to describe this is through _binary._  Imagine an 8-bit index describing 256 potential points 
evenly and incrementally spread from zero to infinity.  Next, a _10-bit_ index holding 1024 potentials also distributed
across the infinite void.  The larger index _describes_ the space more densely, but their relative sizes allow a _potential 
difference_ to be calculated between their contained values. 

Even though it's less _resolute,_ the smaller index can _imitate_ the larger since their bit-widths define their _**relative 
resolution**_.  

This brings me to my first key word:

    " The Index "
        The act of abstractly bounding anything in disctretized space so as to define its resolution.

This isn't just a binary construct!  

On the index of performances, my rendition of _Stairway to Heaven_ is too fuzzy for most to even recognize - _but it still **registers** on the scale!_  

Luckily, numbers are easier for me to explain - so I'll spare Your ears, _for now_ =)

    tl;dr - an index defines the potential measurement marks on a ruler spread across infinity

      why - this represents a variable width register
