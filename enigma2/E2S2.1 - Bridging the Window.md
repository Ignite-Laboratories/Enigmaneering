# `E2S2.1 - Bridging the Window`

### Pinning Go Routines
The point of EGL is to connect a renderable _surface_ to a rendering _context_ - to do so requires the OpenGL _pipeline,_
which has a very specific limitation - the _context_ must only be operated on by one _thread_ at a time.  Specifically,
a _thread_ - not a Go routine!  Under the hood, Go can move your Go routine to another host thread at any time - which
inherently _breaks_ the pipeline's ability to access _unsafe_ memory (or any memory outside of the scope of Go.)  As such,
the absolute _first_ thing that must be done for sparking operations that leverage a GL context is calling 
`runtime.LockOSThread()` - this is a Go feature that ensures the currently executing Go routine is _pinned_ to a singular
host thread and should _not_ be moved.

### Creating a Renderable Window
The _only_ surface we are currently exploring is a _window;_ thus, let's start by creating our `RenderableWindow` - 

    func init() {
        fmt.Println("[host] - Linux - EGL graphics bridge")
    }
    
    // SparkRenderableWindow creates a new GL renderable window using EGL.
    func SparkRenderableWindow(renderer Renderable) *RenderableWindow {
        handle := window.Create()
        sparkEGLBridge(handle, renderer)
    
        v := &RenderableWindow{}
        v.handle = handle
        return v
    }

Next, we will need some kind of renderable structure - 

    type SolidColorWindow struct {
        *graphics.RenderableWindow
        Color std.RGBA
    }
    
    func NewSolidColorWindow(color std.RGBA) *SolidColorWindow {
        return &SolidColorWindow{
            Color: color,
        }
    }
    
    func (w *SolidColorWindow) Render() {
        // Clear the window with a background color
        gl.ClearColor(w.Color.R, w.Color.G, w.Color.B, w.Color.A)
        gl.Clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
    }

This kind of window will simply display a solid color at all times - _through OpenGL._  Next, we will need to
bridge the two together - let's step through the `sparkEGLBridge(window, renderer)` function -

    // Pin to a singular host thread
	runtime.LockOSThread()
	defer runtime.UnlockOSThread()

	// Initialize EGL
	display := egl.GetDisplay(egl.DEFAULT_DISPLAY)
	if display == egl.NO_DISPLAY {
		log.Fatal("Failed to get EGL display")
	}
	if !egl.Initialize(display, nil, nil) {
		log.Fatal("Failed to initialize EGL")
	}
	defer egl.Terminate(display)

Here we are grabbing the "default" display - in my experience, that means whichever display currently has _focus._
This would be the display that the _mouse cursor_ currently exists upon, which is absolutely acceptable.  The next
component I would like to highlight is the _heavy use_ of the `defer` keyword!  Lots of these things can clean
themselves up when their loops terminate _naturally_ - which should be leveraged _whenever possible!_

Let's continue -

	// Choose an EGL configuration
	attribs := []int32{
		egl.RED_SIZE, 8,                       // 8-bit Red channel
		egl.GREEN_SIZE, 8,                     // 8-bit Green channel
		egl.BLUE_SIZE, 8,                      // 8-bit Blue channel
		egl.DEPTH_SIZE, 24,                    // 24-bit Depth buffer
		egl.STENCIL_SIZE, 8,                   // 8-bit Stencil buffer
		egl.SURFACE_TYPE, egl.WINDOW_BIT,      // Rendering surface type: window
		egl.RENDERABLE_TYPE, egl.OPENGL_BIT,   // Enable OpenGL rendering
		egl.NONE,                              // End of attribute list
	}
	var config egl.Config
	var numConfigs int32
	if !egl.ChooseConfig(display, attribs, &config, 1, &numConfigs) || numConfigs == 0 {
		log.Fatal("Failed to choose EGL configuration")
	}

This sets the basics of rendering through EGL using OpenGL up - the details of which are pretty straightforward,
so I leave it up to you to research further if you'd like.  The Khronos Group, naturally, has excellent [documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/EGL/sdk/docs/man/html/eglChooseConfig.xhtml). 

Moving along -

	// Create EGL surface for the X11 window
	surface := egl.CreateWindowSurface(display, config, egl.NativeWindowType(uintptr(window.Id)), nil)
	if surface == egl.NO_SURFACE {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create EGL surface: %v", egl.GetError())
	}
	defer egl.DestroySurface(display, surface)

	// Create an EGL OpenGL context
	context := egl.CreateContext(display, config, egl.NO_CONTEXT, nil)
	if context == egl.NO_CONTEXT {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create EGL context: %v", egl.GetError())
	}
	defer egl.DestroyContext(display, context)

_This_ is where we finally get to the concept of a _rendering context._  A rendering context is a _handle_ to
an object in memory that can have rendering operations performed upon it, if it is made _active_ on the current
thread.  By design OpenGL only allows a _single_ context to be active on the current thread, and that context
must be _detached_ if another thread would like to pick it up.  Contexts can also be _shared_ amongst threads,
providing access to textures and buffers and such from other threads, but the mechanic of sharing a context is 
beyond our current scope.    

Let's keep going -

	// Initialize EGL and OpenGL for this window
	if !egl.MakeCurrent(display, surface, surface, context) {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to make EGL context current: %v", egl.GetError())
	}

	// Initialize OpenGL
	if err := gl.Init(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize OpenGL: %v", err)
	}

Here's where we make the context _current_ - meaning future `GL` operations on that thread will happen on _that_
context.  This is where we _finally_ start making GL calls, starting with the most important call, to `gl.Init()` - 
this is _required_ after either making a context current or before _any_ other GL calls, in general.

	// Start rendering
	for core.Alive {
		renderer.Render()
		// Swap the buffers to display the rendered frame
		egl.SwapBuffers(display, surface)
	}

Finally, we call our renderable renderer's `Render()` method and then swap the graphical buffer.  OpenGL works by rendering
one buffer to the screen while drawing to a secondary buffer.  At the end of all drawing operations, swapping the drawing and 
display buffers like this is what renders the output onto the screen.

Let's wrap it up by updating our example's main method to use the new features included in the `host.graphics` package -

    func main() {
        for i := 0; i < 7; i++ {
		    graphics.SparkRenderableWindow(NewSolidColorWindow(std.RandomRGB()))
        }
        core.Impulse.StopWhen(window.StopPotential)
        core.Impulse.Spark()
    }

At this point, you should have seven colorful windows on your screen!  Now, you can mess with the `Render()` method of
the provided example to try out your chops at drawing things in GL =)
