### Cross-_Language_ Compilation
As is tradition software creation, let's start with the most basic example of calling a C function from Go - "Hello, World!"

    /*
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void SayHi() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
    */
    import "C"
    
    func main() {
        C.SayHi()
    }

God, I love this language.  It's truly this simple to integrate C into your Go programs!  That, however, opens
a huge can of worms for exploration that I'm only just beginning to explore.  For posterity's sake, here are
some of the notable pitfalls you should be aware of:

- You will need `gcc` installed, and on Linux you will need `libx11-dev` installed
- _Do not put an empty line between the comment and `import "C"` directive_
- `fflush(stdout)` is needed for some IDEs to print the console output, but it isn't strictly necessary here

### Cross-platform design

Going forward beyond this step I won't be detailing the other host architectures as much - but I feel it's
important to walk through the basics of how to write cross-platform compilable code in Go.

Let's start by grabbing the mouse cursor coordinates, in Linux -

    //go:build linux
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #cgo LDFLAGS: -lX11
    #include <X11/Xlib.h>
    
    static void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        Display *display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        if (display == NULL) return;
    
        Window root, child;
        int root_x, root_y;
        int win_x, win_y;
        unsigned int mask;
    
        XQueryPointer(display, DefaultRootWindow(display), &root, &child,
                      &root_x, &root_y, &win_x, &win_y, &mask);
        *x = root_x;
        *y = root_y;
        XCloseDisplay(display);
    }
    */
    import "C"

I won't walk you through the C code, itself - it's quite self-explanatory!  However, there are a few _gotchas_ 
that you should be privy to:

- X11 is the windowing library for Linux machines, making it _crucial_
- It must be added to the _linker_, hence the `#cgo LDFlAGS: -lX11` call
- The very first line of the file restricts this specific file to _only_ build on Linux environments.

If you would like to do the same on a Windows machine, the call is a little simpler -

    //go:build windows
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #include <windows.h>
    
    void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        POINT p;
        GetCursorPos(&p);
        *x = p.x;
        *y = p.y;
    }
    */
    import "C"

And, on Darwin -

    //go:build darwin
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>
    
    void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        CGPoint point = CGEventGetLocation(kCGEventNull);
        *x = (int)point.x;
        *y = (int)point.y;
    }
    */
    import "C"

### Calling the function
To call the above functions is also quite straightforward - 

    func GetMouseCoordinates() (x int, y int) {
        var cX, cY C.int
        C.GetMouseCoordinates(&cX, &cY)
        return int(cX), int(cY)
    }

However, as you likely noticed - `int` and `C.Int` are not the same type.  Not only that, the parameters
are _passed by reference_ rather than returned.  These are just a few of the idiosyncrasies that come with
interoping between C and Go.  The next is critical to ensuring _graceful_ calls to a C function - handling
panics -

    import "fmt"
    
    func (m mouse) GetCoordinates() (x int, y int, err error) {
        defer func() {
            if r := recover(); r != nil {
                err = fmt.Errorf("failed to get mouse position: %v", r)
            }
        }()
    
        var cX, cY C.int
        C.GetMouseCoordinates(&cX, &cY)
        return int(cX), int(cY), nil
    }

As we are crossing the border from safe operation into other libraries, it is best to guard the entry
and exit points whenever possible with _recovery_ operations.  Please bear with me - I'm learning
how to write cross-language code right along side of you.

**NOTE:** _This_ particular step includes a local _host_ package you can use to poke around with cross-language compilation.
