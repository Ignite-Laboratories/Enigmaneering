# `E2 - Phrase Locked Loops`
### `Alex Petz, Ignite Laboratories, February 2026`

Now that I've established what _synthesis_ is and provided you with a universal coordinate system, the next phase
is to cyclically _animate_ the described field.  

The goal is to facilitate _**massively parallel**_ execution of _**localized**_ calculations.

To do this, I turned to _GPU shaders._

When a shader is launched, a wave of kernels is executed.  Their position in the wave dictates the _phase offset_
they should wait before picking up any work.  Because of fidelity space, you can tune both the number of wave
points _and_ the loop period to dynamically change the _resolution_ of execution.  This, in turn, allows you to
set _**global**_ frame rates and phase-lock them to external factors like your monitor's v-sync.

You'd be able to tune the _**coarseness**_ through which your system resolves universal memory.

The implications are _astounding!_  This allows you to dynamically change the efficiency through which different
aspects of a parallel system are manifested into each other's awareness _and_ the degree to which they can calculate
a logical conclusion.

For me?

This defines _**Love.**_

The more time you allow another system to render itself in front of you, the less aliased its curves and edges become =)

Ultimately - this leads me to propose an _**absurdly** difficult to disprove_ notion:
