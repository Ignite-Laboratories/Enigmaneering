### Spawn Pools
What I described in the last step was a form of a neural _spawn pool._  To implement this,
we will head over to the `engine` and start adding _clustered activation_ functions - starting
with the below `Cascading(...)` design.  The idea is simple - how can we fire a single function
as fast as possible in a looping fashion without creating thousands of goroutines in the process?

_By distributing activation across space (threads) and time (impulses)_

On every impulse, the cluster will fire only _one_ of its neurons - but it'll intelligently
select which to fire using in a _first-in-first-out_ queue.  This allows the same threads to be
recycled for the provided number of cycles while _staggering_ their execution with whichever
neuron is ready.

    core.engine -
        func (e *Engine) Cascade(action Action, potential Potential, muted bool, x *uint64) *Cluster {
            c := &Cluster{}
            c.ID = NextID()
            c.engine = e
            c.Neurons = make([]*Neuron, 0)
            c.Action = func(ctx Context) {
                c.ActivationCount++
                c.executing = true
        
                var neuron *Neuron
                
                // Grab the first non-destroyed neuron...
                var trimCount int
                for _, n := range c.Neurons{
                    trimCount++
                    if n.Destroyed {
                        continue
                    }
                    neuron = n
                    break
                }
                // ...and truncate the queue
                c.Neurons = c.Neurons[trimCount:]
                
                // Check if we should spawn a new neuron
                if neuron == nil || neuron.executing {
                    if neuron != nil {
                        // If the neuron is still executing, send it to the back of the line
                        c.Neurons = append(c.Neurons, neuron)
                    }
                    // Spawn a replacement
                    neuron = e.LoopXTimes(action, potential, muted, x)
                }
                // Re-queue the neuron
                c.Neurons = append(c.Neurons, neuron)
                
                // Send the impulse along to the found neuron
                neuron.channel <- ctx
            }
            c.Potential = potential
            c.Muted = muted
        
            e.addNeuron(c.Neuron)
            return c
        }
