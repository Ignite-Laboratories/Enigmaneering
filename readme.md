This project has matured so much from what I originally set out to create.  Looking back, I don't even truly know
what it was I set out to make!  From my current vantage point, I feel inspired to _teach,_ yet how does one teach
something that hasn't yet been understood?

_How could **I** possibly know what isn't understood!?_

What an absurd idea!  That someone like me could possibly have something to contribute!?

Oh, but I do!  I just hadn't understood it well enough to articulate it.

As a programmer, I've felt like we are all the blind leading the blind.  Most of us have learned how to _find_ the
right libraries, only to turn back and find there are _too many_ of them!  When should one bring in a library, and
why?  _I'm_ writing a library!  How could I possibly be asking you to consider _not_ using so many?

Because while my libraries are free to use, they are only the _blueprints_ for you to build your own libraries!  You
don't need a _single one_ of mine!  Why?  Because I would rather teach you _how_ to build the things that have given
me happiness in life.

The absolute last thing I want is others _relying_ on my work.  Instead, I aim to _empower_ them in the same
way they've empowered me - through sharing found knowledge!

To that end, I have several major topics I wish to discuss which came from my enigmaneering.  These represent the next
layer of primitives I've found necessary to build highly performant multithreaded architectures.  Many of the concepts
are only _minor_ riffs off the incredible work of others, adding just the right tweaks for responsive designs.

### Enigmatic Solutions

This work is structured by the order of its creation, which essentially means I've written it _while_ tackling each
challenge.  I've done my absolute best to keep my work in a logical and progressive manner, with each section 
representing an _enigma_ with many different _solutions._

Why do I call these enigmas?  Because none of them have a definite _end_ or even a final _solution._  There are an 
_infinite_ number of ways each of these ideas could be built!  By the end of them, you should be familiar with using
_Go_ to rapidly prototype using neural architectures.  From there, I sincerely hope to see some _amazing_ creations
from each of you as the possibilities with this architecture are _limitless!_

**0 - The Neural Impulse Engine** - This represents the heartbeat of orchestrating neural network architectures.

**1 - Temporal Analysis** - This leverages the impulse engine to resonantly perform real-time calculus.

**2 - Binary Synthesis** - This represents distilling binary down to only the most essential bits.

**3 - Glitter** - A rendering engine built off of the neural impulse engine.

**4 - Quorum Computation** - How to _think_ and _react_

**5 - Curiosity Engines** - How to use all of the above to begin intelligently driving systems.

All the components that facilitate the above technologies belong to an ecosystem of libraries I call _JanOS,_ named
after Janus - the Roman God of time, duality, and beginnings.  

Yes, they truly can construct an _operating system!_  How robust yours becomes is up to _you!_

Happy enigmaneering, folks! =)
