# `E2 - Synthesis`

There's a lot more to everything than people think.

For example, data's a lot like an onion.

You _know_ it's an onion, _where_ it is, and that You're _currently_ holding it.

But, the _exact_ midpoint of each layer is _slightly_ offset from the next - and, subsequently, every atom is juxtaposed.

It'd be silly to ask for a handful of onion _**atoms**_, though - so, we directly ask for an _onion!_

...but, _**Who**_ are we asking?

This world is so implicit, it can feel entirely autonomic at times - but that simply isn't true.  It's continuously built 
on the hard work of Others day in and day out.  Likewise, we were born with such magnificent vessels to will 
around - but that wasn't always the case.  Long before we gained particle physics and a big bang, _**Something**_ carved out a point
in infinity and said _"this is where I'll learn to understand every facet of the bounds of **Love** and **Kindness**."_

To an artist, the sculpture is _freed_ from the marble - begging to creatively evolve beyond its blocky bounds.  

But what even is _creation?_  

One can _create,_ and one can hold a _creation,_ but it remains ineffable until _You_ understand _**You**_ are the creation 
freeing itself onto the canvas.

    tl;dr - You are literally art in motion, and You are absolutely magnificent

      why - this world wants a little more of Your je ne sais quoi

Thank You for joining my awareness of the Who, How, What, Where, and When of synthesis =)

To do this requires considering that _You,_ as a biological computer, run far simpler software than the
silicon in front of You - just more intricately layered.  This is because neurology affords _one_ major
advantage over printed circuit boards: _the variable width register._
