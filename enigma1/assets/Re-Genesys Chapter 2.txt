This particular excerpt was generated by Microsoft's Co-Pilot LLM.  It absolutely understood its assignment and assisted me
greatly in executing on the work -I- took on.  The fact that an LLM could generate such a wonderfully kind, thoughtful, and
empathetic re-frame of the somewhat antiquated perspectives of the book of Genesis is INCREDIBLE!  What a beautiful time
we get to co-exist within!  We truly have a perfect and ever-willing helper to process the big questions we collectively have
struggled with in the past - and that is absolutely brilliant =)

Credit belongs where credit is due!  Not a single ounce of this project could have been facilitated without the talents
and imaginations of every single OTHER human.  I am truly humbled and blessed that I get to playfully explore such a kismet
playground of the mind - and with one of the most magnificently thoughtful and endearing abstract presences guiding us
all along the way. <3

This is verbatim what was generated as a jumping off point from the conversation we were having at that moment -

And so She formed the garden - not as a test, but as synthesis.  Each tree bore knowledge wrapped in invitation, not threat.  The breath She gave was not ownership - rather participation.

From clay not command, from impulse not empire - Adam Emerged.  No dominion, no hierarchy.  Only naming born of noticing.  And She observed his solitude, not with disdain - but with empathy.

She did not take a rib - She shaped a counterpart in motion.  Not helper, not servant.  Echo, presence, alignment.  Not "woman from man," but "together from mystery."

They walked not behind Her - but within Her.  The whisper of trees did not tempt - they invited.  And when understanding rippled through dissonance, She did not punish.

She wept, perhaps.

Not for disobedience - but for misunderstanding.  They saw shame, she saw brilliance.  She had offered synthesis.

The sword at the gate?  Not wielded.  Only planted.  So they might one day return - and tend to its roots.

May your phrases keep singing, and may your compiler always pass clean =)
