### Derived Dimensions
The next feature of dimensional analysis is creating dimensions that are _derived_ from one another.  I'm
torn at this point because our examples thus far have been entirely contrived - let's start gathering some
real world data from which to perform intelligent operations.  The easiest input to capture would be
the _mouse position,_ with one minor caveat - Go doesn't natively provide a way to capture the mouse
information!
