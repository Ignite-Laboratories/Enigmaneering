# `E1 - Diminishment`

Now that we've established the general _concept_ of manifestation through neural signals - _synthesis_ - it's time to begin
_utilizing_ it!

My first challenge has been to synthesize a _file_ from the smallest seed value possible.  There are a surprising
number of ways to do this - so many so that it's shocking we _haven't_ yet, as I've metaphorically been "stumbling" 
over them.

The rub isn't that it's _hard_ - it's just hard to do it _reliably._

That's because of the below graph of the magnitude necessary to _**distinguish**_ a potential relative to the midpoint 
of _**all**_ indexes

[Insert index compressibility chart here]

**Files scatter _everywhere_ across this chart!**

More importantly, recursive midpointing of an unideal potential causes its magnitude to _oscillate_ in and out of the
ideal range with each successive distinguishment. Luckily, using a _phrase,_ we can write bitwise scripts to _"push"_ 
the file into an ideal position _before_ attempting to distinguish it!  

I'll be doing this through fidelity space using something I call _diminishment_ of an index.

    " Index Diminishment "
        Using a less resolute pattern to quickly approximate an index potential.

Or, in simpler terms, _"fuzzy pattern matching"_ =)

The term diminishment comes from the musical world.  Diminished _chords_ have two important qualities: every
interval is as equidistant as possible, and they are extremely _versatile_ against many sounds.  

At this point, we're going to begin evolving our signals into _**notes!**_

    tl;dr - indexes have an ideal range of potential compressibility defined under an exponential bell curve

      why - the magnitude's binary representation grows logarithmically as the potential moves away from the midpoint
