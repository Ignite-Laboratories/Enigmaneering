### Time is shared

I've circled around on the ordering of dimensions in my mind for quite some time now.  After writing yesterday's
draft, however, I recognized a fatal flaw in my logic - time could never exist _between_ consciousness and physical
form.  In my coding experiments, I've found this also held true - the more I attempted to force execution timing, the more taxing
it was on the computer.  Seemingly small processes would spike across cores at unsustainable intervals, negating the
project's viability.  What dawned on me is that even our _creator_ would have a shared temporal axis with ourselves,
applied by the bounds of _Her_ creator.  This structural re-ordering is small, but has massive implications -

    X, Y, Z
    Awareness
    Consciousness
    Universal
    Temporal

First, it means that consciousness could only _predictively model_ against time - not actively control its 
exection.  This makes the work of replicating such a simulation _immensely_ simpler, as the passing of time can become
an _artifact_ implied by the highest level of neural execution.  Circling back to my "padding engine" model, the ability
to "control execution" comes from the generation of artifacts by a lower dimension - as these are owned by _that_ conscious
index.  

Think of it like dancing!  The best movement comes from relaxing control and letting the motion flow - because you literally
are requesting _less points_ to synchronize with your partner's across space and time.  By submitting to the passing of time, 
you fall into a far more natural groove which often looks and feels better to the external observer.

Mentally, that's _rehearsing_ for the part we want to play.  

Physically, that's _manifesting_ your desires into reality.

Intellectually, that's appreciating that time is _provided._

My software engineering friends will appreciate that last point the most.  Why?  Because this particular structure allows
_real time physical simulation_ as a fundamental primitive - not one given by a layer of abstraction.  The concept of time
and space comes as a _byproduct_ of natural execution in a computed environment.  Remember, my goal is NOT to force you
to build these system off of MY code - I want you to understand the _fundamentals_ of a neural architecture.

### Padding

Now that we have the order of dimensions built, let's explore the mechanics of a rolling temporal frame buffer.  In a
padding operation we provide several key bits of information:

     directional "side" ⬎      result width ⬎      ⬐ source data
    pad.String[orthogonal.Left, scheme.Tile](10, "11111", "ABC")    // BACBA11111
                         padding scheme ⬏          pattern ⬏

Chief of these is the resulting _width._  This tells the engine to _truncate_ information while pa
