### Slow Down!!!
Let's do the most simple kind of derivative reaction - tell the user when they move their mouse _too damn fast!_

To do so, we have a new kind of temporal dimension to work with - the _Reaction_

	temporal.Reaction(core.Impulse, when.Frequency(&mouse.SampleRate), false, mouse.SampleCoordinates, VelocityReaction)

    func VelocityReaction(ctx core.Context, old std.Data[std.XY[int]], current std.Data[std.XY[int]]) {
        delta := current.Point.X - old.Point.X
        deltaAbs := math.Abs(float64(delta))
        if deltaAbs > 100 {
            fmt.Println("Slow down!!!")
        }
    }

Here, our `VelocityReaction` function has a `Change` function signature - 

    type Change[TValue any] func(ctx core.Context, old std.Data[TValue], current std.Data[TValue])

This kind of dimension calls the change function whenever it is activated by its potential returning true.  For that
reason, this kind of 'reactionary' dimension is used to perform intelligent reactions _to_ a changing dimensional
value.

The `mouse` package also provides a way to quickly create a mouse reaction dimension - 

    mouse.Reaction(core.Impulse, &mouse.SampleRate, Velocity)

Note that as of this writing the _only_ data getting sampled by mouse is the cursor coordinates, but as the project
evolves this dimension will reflect that data as well.
