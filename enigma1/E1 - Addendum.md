From this point onward, I'll be referring to very specific bit-width indexes.  In most cases, I'll refer
to them by their bit-width directly - but in some, I've chosen to use the colloquial names I was taught.

These are especially helpful when verbalizing a phrase!

This:

    "use a 3-bit measurement, then a 2-bit measurement, and end with a byte"

Is a lot clunkier to speak out loud than:

    "use a note, then a crumb, and end with a byte"

I've grouped these in two:

**Sub Byte Indexes** - any bit range less than 8 bits:

      Index | Name
        1   | Bit
        2   | Crumb
        3   | Note
        4   | Nibble
        5   | Flake
        6   | Morsel
        7   | Shred

**Super Byte Indexes** - any bit range wider than 8 bits.  

I almost _never_ refer to these, but for posterity's sake I'd like to include them here.  

None of these are standard or accepted terms, merely my own ideas:

      Index | Name
       10   | Run
       11   | Blush
       12   | Scale
       16   | Motif
       24   | Riff
       32   | Cadence
       48   | Hook
       64   | Melody
      128   | Verse
