### Resonant Calculation
While that may initially sound daunting, genuinely consider what I'm stating!  Currently, our operating systems
perform _concurrent serial_ calculation.  The only difference resonance brings to the mix is that each 
calculation is _stimulated,_ rather than _ordered_ - kinda like software interrupts!  We've already heavily 
covered the basics of how to use action potentials to drive neural activations, but now we get to use these 
concepts to perform _real time calculus operations!_

To _integrate_ is to take infinitesimally small measurements of something until you can approximate it with a
high degree of accuracy.  If you consider a _signal_ across time to be _observable,_ then the act of taking
smaller and smaller observances of the signal is a form of _fuzzy integration._  The reason it's a _fuzzy_
integral is because there isn't always a guarantee you have observed _every_ possible instant of time, and
the _rate_ of observance directly affects your results.  The fact remains that unless you control the _generation_ 
of a signal, you can never _gauarantee_ you will observe every value it could occupy across time.

_But that's okay!_

If you take that as a _positive_ aspect of a real-time calculus engine, then you can separate the _observance_ 
and _analysis_ of the signal as _resonant tasks._  One can _observe_ at a high frequency while the analyzer 
fires at a slower rate, then on the next activation the analyzer can perform calculation on whatever data it 
_missed_ but the observer recorded.  I briefly touched on this in the first enigma when I mentioned _temporal
fragment shading -_

All of these features are a direct _byproduct_ of neural architectures =)

Throughout this enigma we'll be exploring how to leverage real-time integration, differentiation, and analysis.
