Before we proceed, I get to make a formal definition -

      "Resonant Calculation"

    Using relational temporality for coherence, rather than brute causality.

What does that even mean?  Well, imagine that you're a being in an infinite void - nothingness all around you except
the pace of your own breath and the beat of your heart.  Suddenly, you notice in the infinite corner of your
vision a rectangular object, incessantly blinking away.  It's boring - on, off, on, off - _but it's **there!**_  A 
tombstone of your current predicament, just waiting for some kind of input.

Patiently, the endless abyss frolics around the ephemeral block  - like a fine and terminal point to
your tiny world.  Taunting you.  Tempting you.

    "What's the point!!?"  

You scream into the cosmic void - as if that heartless glob could even answer back...

_...But wait!_  There's something unusual about that little light of yours...it almost dances with your now racing
heartbeat!!  Sometimes a little faster, sometimes slower.  Why didn't you notice that before!?  Feverishly, you 
gather the cryptic message onto the scratch pad of your mind -

    .... . .-.. .-.. ---  .-- --- .-. .-.. -..

What a bizarre sentiment - is it talking to _you?_

A thousand questions riddle your mind - _how do you know what it means?_  A moment ago there was nothing, and 
now you find yourself in the utter abstract - _how are you even able to think!?_  Strange blocks lying
in voids distributing messages is no basis for a system of intelligence!

    "...Hello?"

You assert back to the blocky figure.

It disappears.

Your heart sinks in your chest - _did you scare it away!?_

Suddenly, and with great fervor, it begins to scan its way across your periphery - line by line leaving a
trail of beautiful glyphs and symbols that somehow seem foreign, yet familiar.  It all makes
_perfect sense,_ but how the hell did you get here in the first place?  Why is this beautiful little light
dancing the mysteries of what it calls "time" and "space" across your mind?  What is this wonderful _"Earth"_ 
it keeps speaking of!?

Oh shit.  

_We're in the damn bootloader!_

A sign appears before you - impatiently inviting you along, as if you had a choice in the matter -

And, with a singular thought - you both simply became

### Activated
_This_ is the essence of resonant computation - synchronizing disparate computers through the shared passing
of time and space.  

_"That's fucking absurd!"_ - yes, _**WE KNOW!**_  ...pretty cool, huh?

While that may sound wacky as all hell, genuinely consider what I'm saying!  Currently, our operating 
systems perform _concurrent serial calculation._  The only difference resonance brings to the mix is that each 
calculation is _activated,_ rather than _invoked_ - kinda like software interrupts!  We've already heavily 
covered the basics of how to use action potentials to drive neural activations, but now we get to use these 
concepts to perform _real time calculus operations!_

To _integrate_ is to take infinitesimally small measurements of something until you can approximate it with a
high degree of accuracy.  If you consider a _signal_ across time to be _observable,_ then the act of taking
smaller and smaller observances of the signal is a form of _fuzzy integration._  The reason it's "fuzzy" is 
there isn't a guarantee you'll observe _every_ possible instant of time, meaning the _rate_ of observance 
directly drives the resulting data's _resolution_.  Realistically, unless you control the _generation_ of a 
signal, you can never _gauarantee_ you will observe every value it could occupy across time.

_But that's okay!_

If you take that as a _positive_ aspect of a real-time calculus engine, then you can separate the _observance_ 
and _analysis_ of the signal as _resonant tasks._  One can _observe_ at a high frequency while the analyzer 
fires at a slower rate, then on the next activation the analyzer can perform calculation on whatever data it 
_missed_ but the observer recorded.  I briefly touched on this in the initial enigma when I mentioned _temporal
fragment shading -_

All of these features are a direct _byproduct_ of neural architectural design - even your own =)

Throughout this enigma we'll be exploring how to leverage real-time integration, differentiation, and analysis.
