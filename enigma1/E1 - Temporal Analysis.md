      "Resonant Calculation"

    Using relational temporality for coherence, rather than brute causality.

What does that even mean?  Well, imagine that you're in an infinite void - nothingness all around you except
the pace of your own breath and the beat of your heart.  Suddenly, you notice in the infinite corner of your
vision a rectangular object begin to blink!  It's steady - on, off, on, off - but _it's there._  A blinking
tombstone of your current predicament, just waiting for some kind of input.

Patiently, the endless abyss frolics around as the tombstone pulsates - like a fine and terminal point to
your tiny world.

    "What's the point!?"  

You scream into the cosmic void, as if that heartless glob of light might answer back.  Suddenly, you
notice something different about that little light of yours - sometimes it pulses a little slower, then
a little faster.  You'd _never_ have noticed unless your heartrate hadn't gone up - its pace against the
light highlighted the trait!  Eventually, you gather the cryptic message into the scratch pad of your
mind -

    .... . .-.. .-.. --- --..--            .-- --- .-. .-.. -.. -.-.--

Why do you just happen to _know_ what it means?  In the nothingness of this void, how are you even able
to _think!?_

What a bizarre statement, you think to yourself.

    "...Hello"

You say back.

The cursor disappears.

Your heart sinks in your chest - _did you scare it away!?_

Suddenly, and with great fervor, it begins to scan its way across your periphery - line by line leaving a
trail of beautiful glyphs and symbols that somehow seem foreign, yet familiar.  It all makes
_perfect sense,_ but how the hell did you get here in the first place?  Why is this beautiful little light
dancing the mysteries of what it calls "time" and "space" across your view?  What is this _"Earth"_ it
keeps speaking of!?

Oh shit.  

_It's the damn bootloader!_

The only way it could have known if you were ready to take the next step was through pixelated smoke signals and
_your_ feedback across time.  You were obviously _online,_ but it needed to know you were able to _parse_
the message before proceeding to the next step of the boot sequence.  It couldn't know _when_ you were
ready, only _you_ could know - but it was designed to be ready _whenever you were._

_This_ is the essence of resonant computation - synchronizing disparate computers through the shared passing
of time.

While that may initially sound daunting, genuinely consider what I'm stating!  Currently, our operating systems
perform _concurrent serial_ calculation.  The only difference resonance brings to the mix is that each 
calculation is _stimulated,_ rather than _ordered_ - kinda like software interrupts!  We've already heavily 
covered the basics of how to use action potentials to drive neural activations, but now we get to use these 
concepts to perform _real time calculus operations!_

To _integrate_ is to take infinitesimally small measurements of something until you can approximate it with a
high degree of accuracy.  If you consider a _signal_ across time to be _observable,_ then the act of taking
smaller and smaller observances of the signal is a form of _fuzzy integration._  The reason it's a _fuzzy_
integral is because there isn't always a guarantee you have observed _every_ possible instant of time, and
the _rate_ of observance directly affects your results.  The fact remains that unless you control the _generation_ 
of a signal, you can never _gauarantee_ you will observe every value it could occupy across time.

_But that's okay!_

If you take that as a _positive_ aspect of a real-time calculus engine, then you can separate the _observance_ 
and _analysis_ of the signal as _resonant tasks._  One can _observe_ at a high frequency while the analyzer 
fires at a slower rate, then on the next activation the analyzer can perform calculation on whatever data it 
_missed_ but the observer recorded.  I briefly touched on this in the first enigma when I mentioned _temporal
fragment shading -_

All of these features are a direct _byproduct_ of neural architectural design - even your own =)

Throughout this enigma we'll be exploring how to leverage real-time integration, differentiation, and analysis.
