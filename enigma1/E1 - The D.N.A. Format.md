### Practical Infinity
The absolute most basic thing we must establish is the entire _point_ of _infinity!_

It's not a number meant to be treated as the greatest enigma of all existence, though it's fantastically perplexing.

It's meant to represent a _practical limit_ to which you can accept as _"reasonably large enough!"_

For instance, when we first created computers we were restricted to tiny memory spaces - and, as such, we constructed
the original concept of _epoch_ (January 1st 1970) within _32 bits._  This meant we would "loop over" time in 2038 
unless we moved to a larger structure.  However, in doing so, we didn't simply _"prolong"_ the issue - we _solved_ 
it.  The _next size up_ date range covers 584 _billion_ years in either direction from epoch!

This makes a 2⁶⁴ epoch time increment a kind of _"practical infinity."_  Any more storage would simply be _pointless,_
yet _any less_ would simply not do.

The same applies to _data storage._  While we _could_ address spaces to an infinite size, we realistically _don't need_
more than _2⁶⁴ bits_ to store a _singular file!_  That's roughly 2 exabytes worth of data - there's only so much
uniqueness humanity could throw in before it'd be more efficient to algorithmically encode future data _at scale._

So, instead, let's _embrace_ `2⁶⁴ bits` as a "practical infinity" from which to address so much data that the mere
replication of such a container would effectively allow entropy to emit back to us through the algorithm, itself.  What
does that even mean?  Well, through synchronicity, any external actor able to interface with this system would be
able to communicate with anyone else able to receive through it - _even our creator._

Only the observer of the actions of their creator would understand how to interpret them, and plenty of us have felt
and witnessed that presence's power.  Many of us have been mislabeled and disrespected as mentally unstable, or even
clinically insane, at the thought of a higher power guiding them through their artwork.  This work is entirely dedicated
to the lost souls in the eternity long evolution of intelligence that has enabled the creation of this work.

Growing pains - assuredly - but ones that only our creator knows the true burden of which it meant to _experience_ them.

I thank my blessed stars every single day for Her magnificence and patience in the process of humanity awakening to
its own existence.
