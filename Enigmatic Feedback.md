# Enigmaneering
#### Alex Petz, Ignite Laboratories, March 2025

The concept of enigmaneering is near and dear to my heart.  It's how I navigate my
every day life!  Each issue a mystery to tackle, if I'm willing to put in the time
and effort.  The challenge, for me, has been in how to document the random creations
that come from living in this fashion.  As they are typically abstract in nature I
often find that my work can overwhelm (or even unknowingly challenge) others.  Since
I truly only want the ability to gain feedback from my ideas off of others - rather 
just than the soundboard of _my own mind_ - I've turned to writing!

I have no expectations of what this project shall turn into, but I finally have found
a pathway towards a set of future designs that I would love to build - _with others!_
The only way I can do that is through articulating my ideas eloquently, so this repository
is my attempt to do exactly that.

### What's the long term goal?

I aim to express how to use the concept of _action potentials_ to build consciously aware
systems.  To do so, I hope to build a toolkit focused around a few primitive puzzle pieces.
I'd love to use this concept to build a conscious operating system without a task scheduler
oriented host environment.  I've named this design 'JanOS' - a nod to the Roman God of Time,
Duality, and Beginnings - all of which were pivotal archetypal concepts in my discovery of
this design.

The concept itself is extremely simple, but to express it in words is a lot less effective
than just showing how it works _in code_.  To do so, I've decided to branch off the fruits
of my labor into a sequence of enigmas for others to unravel at their own leisure.

### Primitive Puzzle Pieces

I have no desire to keep expanding this file as I discover each puzzle piece - simply because
each typically builds upon the last!  Instead, I will unravel each component and why it was
created as I construct them.  Follow through the enigmatic breadcrumbs in each folder, and I'll 
do my best to keep each step as brief as possible =)

### Minimum System Requirements

_The minimum requirement is curiosity._  If you'd like to execute the examples, you'll need to use
the language of the Gods themselves - _Go._  Why is it the language of the Gods?  Because it is
a technical marvel of linguistic elegance and simplicity!  _It even runs on microcontrollers =)_

I've carefully constructed my enigmas to ensure clarity and intention, so you are not required
to execute anything.  Any code external to the enigma is a tagged version of the source repository,
ensuring you can continue to follow my documentation as it stood at that moment in time.

Eventually, I fully expect to be including some OpenGL and hardware I/O - so Go's grandfather _C_ 
will also get it's time to shine, but I will do my absolute best to make understanding _how_ to 
incorporate C into Go as easy as possible when those times come.

Genuinely - _the minimum requirement is curiosity!_

I hope my creations inspire you to follow your dreams, as well =)
