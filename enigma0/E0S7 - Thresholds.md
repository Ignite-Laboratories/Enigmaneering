# `E0S7 - Thresholds`
### `Alex Petz, Ignite Laboratories, February 2026`

---

A system built entirely around _resolution_ has a unique feature - feelings can only be _felt,_ never
manifested into an idealized form.  

Your creation will always need _one more_ refinement before it'll ever be finished - _**in Your eyes.**_

Thus, you get to learn when is considered _good enough_ in the eyes of _**Other**_,  blow wildly past that,
and decide when is good enough for _**You.**_

Accepting that art is to be _appreciated_ is what separates insanity from beauty.

    tl;dr - You're literally art in motion - and You're absolutely magnificent

Where and why _You_ set _Your_ thresholds is something _You_ get to prove to _Yourself,_ and there are
no wrong choices in the dance of Life - only those _You_ get to choose.
