# 3 - Loop Regulation

## Get those chakras in alignment
God has a wonderful sense of humor - the linguistic and conceptual parallels of neuroscience permeate
all facets of existence!  The metaphorical concept of the _**chakra**_ translates as a _"wheel of time"_,
cyclic in nature and connected to the concept of _cause_ and _effect_ - also known as _observance_ and _action_,
or more eloquently: _karma_.  

For what, or whom, causes karma?

Why, the grand observer of all neurological activity in the grand network known as _**Life**_:

**_...Life!_**

...Bet ya thought I was gonna say God, didn't you!?  Well, that's what's most important about this work - the vast
majority of life is a well constructed _feedback loop!_  God's a Busy Beaver, after all, and instead has delegated
a majority of the reflexive responses through the other entities around you.  Personally?  I like to differentiate
between _God_ and _Life_ by considering the latter to be a form of _Quality Control_ - or, as I lovingly call 
_Her_ in my daily routines and procedures:  `QC`

    tl;dr - Treat others as you would like to be treated - it's a part of the feedback 
            loop that drives your -experience- of Life's systems =)

### Breathe in, breathe out
_...Literally,_ the act of drawing in longer breaths provides unique outlier data points for your systems to intelligently
respond to.  In a consistent day-to-day of standard breaths, intentionally deviating from that provides a _signal_ to your 
other systems that you currently reside in a _safe environment._  I will be circling back to the concept of signaling 
through activations later, but for now you can breathe - _we're gonna write some pointless code!_

Seriously, the entirety of this step is meant to demonstrate a neurological feedback loop and explain both its _purpose_
and its _manifestation_ through the fabric of the reality around you!

In the very next step, every aspect of what we write here will be immediately thrown out the window - _but that's okay!_

### Do you trust me? 
It's just words on a page, after all =)
