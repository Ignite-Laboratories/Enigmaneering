# `E0S3 - Midpointing`

Let's recap the journey of how we can manifest an onion:

- **Who gives it to us?** Others through Love and Kindness
- **How?** using layered phrasal measurements
- **Of What?** infinity

That takes us to _**Where!?**_

I've already _half_ discussed this - a _vector_ points us to a location in space - but how does one
_orient_ themselves relative to infinity?

This is where the index comes in handy, but we get to first _distinguish_ it into two halves.  Using a _bit,_ we can
describe two _regions_ of space pivoted around the _midpoint_ to infinity.  Furthermore, we can get _**a lot**_ more
bang from our bit if we consider that the magnitude to follow _**also**_ originates from the midpoint - with a 0
meaning to walk _negatively_ from there and a 1 _positively_.

Most importantly - half of infinity is still _infinite,_ but also _**exactly one bit less wide to describe at all scales.**_

This allows You to _sequentially_ use bit measurements to **infinitely subdivide** a region of space.  If You follow this
phrase with a magnitude, You've also described a _very resolute **point**_ within that region.  The best way to understand
this is to consider that _files_ in Your computer are currently stored as a scalar describing the number of steps
towards infinity to walk before reaching it.  With each midpoint operation, the magnitude of steps _also_ halves - causing
it's bit-width to reduce by **_at least_ one bit.**  This means the data will never _grow_ from a mid-pointing operation,
but _could_ shrink incredibly fast.

At this point we're no longer describing a vector, instead something that bridges topology and geometry - making this
what I'm calling a _directed distinction._

    " A Directed Distinction "
        A recursive phrase of decisions that infinitely subdivide a space

I call the act of locating something with directed distinctions _**distinguishing**_ it.

Midpointing, as we'll discuss next, doesn't have to stretch infinitely in a _single_ direction =)

    tl;dr - midpointing gives mechanical advantage to binary through directed distinctions

      why - this allows You to "zoom in" on either the region containing an onion's atoms, or an individual atom
