# `E0S6 - Platonic Forms`

Now, I get to jump for a moment because fidelity space has many amazing and wonderful implications!

For example, I'd like to prove that _all things have a calculable delta to evolve into "Stairway to Heaven" =)_

The title has already solidified that the most resolute version of the tune is whatever instantly comes
to mind when reminded of it.  From inside, I cannot derive what version _your mind_ has qualified as
"the best" rendition - but I _can_ guarantee that the term "Stairway to Heaven" will trigger a statistical
majority of minds to resolve on a similar-ish version.

Thus, we're presented with two halves:

0. Triggering Others to manifest it in their mind
1. Rendering a version of it which they could guide towards what _**they**_ consider "the best" rendition

A subjective target is constantly _in flux_ - thus, the system rendering a request could only recreate
a _close enough approximation_ to satisfy it in the first place.  

This presents a very basic primitive -

    " The Platonic Form "
        The ideal referential seed with which to render a manifestation from.
