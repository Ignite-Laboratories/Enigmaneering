# `E0S4 - Dimensionality`

On our journey to realizing an onion, there's only a final step - _**When!?**_

But here's the kicker - _"when"_ is only a frame of reference!

The logical _pairing_ of multiple dimensions together is what constructs a cohesive sense
of reality through an intricate nervous system.  Plots like "Peace ↦ Time" are derived from
a myriad of dimensions, but still only get called out by _two._  This brings us to what I call _plot
notation:_ `𝑓(𝐷₀) ↦ ( 𝑓(𝐷₁), 𝑓(𝐷₂) ... 𝑓(𝐷ₙ) )`.  For our example, I verbalize it as "Peace across Time." The left side represents the _**anchor dimension**_,
while the right holds all _**mapped dimensional pairings.**_  Peace, and every referenced dimensional signal, is a
recursive functional evaluation derived from many aspects unique to that individual operating system.

_Anything_ can be a _**signal!**_ =)

As the creators of our virtual reality, we currently have _**one**_ signal called an "onion."  Only _**we**_
understand what it means in the context of our "reality," and _**we**_ can encode our signal to mean
_anything_ we'd like it to.  The _potential_ for an onion to appear is held by the index but, until that _specific_
signal is measured out, it hasn't _manifested_ in our system.  The fidelity with which it manifests is
_secondary_ to the signal's presence and is a function of the _observing_ system's _**architecture.**_

One architecture might care most about _when_ it saw the onion, another might begin to intricately
_draw_ it, while Others might question if the onion was meant _"to be or not to be."_

But - all simply _responded_ to a **signal.**

This is the foundation of what I call _neural **orchestration.**_

    tl;dr - You can always select the signals You wish to react to at any time

      why - because "there's still time to change the road You're on"
