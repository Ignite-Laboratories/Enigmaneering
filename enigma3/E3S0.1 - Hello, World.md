### Cross-_Language_ Compilation
As is tradition, let's start with the most basic example of calling a C function from Go - "Hello, World!"

    /*
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void SayHi() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
    */
    import "C"
    
    func main() {
        C.SayHi()
    }

God, I love this language.  It's truly this simple to integrate C into your Go programs!  That, however, opens
a huge can of worms for exploration.  For posterity's sake, here are some of the notable pitfalls you should be aware of:

- You will need `gcc` installed, and on Linux you will need `libx11-dev` installed for this enigma
- _Do not put an empty line between the comment and `import "C"` directive_
- `fflush(stdout)` is needed for some IDEs to print the console output, but it isn't strictly _necessary_

### Cross-platform design

Going forward beyond this step I won't be detailing the other host architectures as much - but I feel it's
important to walk through the basics of how to write cross-platform compilable code in Go.

Let's start by grabbing the mouse cursor coordinates, in Linux -

    //go:build linux
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #cgo LDFLAGS: -lX11
    #include <X11/Xlib.h>

    static void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        // Open a connection to the X window server
        Display *display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        if (display == NULL) return;
    
        // Get the root window of the default screen
        Window root_window = RootWindow(display, DefaultScreen(display));
        
        // Setup some output variables
        Window root, child;
        int root_x, root_y;
        int win_x, win_y;
        unsigned int mask;
        
        // Query the mouse position relative to the root window found above
        XQueryPointer(display, root_window, &root, &child, &root_x, &root_y, &win_x, &win_y, &mask);
        
        // Assign values to our input parameters
        *x = root_x;
        *y = root_y;
        
        // Be a good samaritan and close the connection to the server
        XCloseDisplay(display); 
    }
    */
    import "C"

I've commented the C code pretty clearly, so I won't go into detail; however, there's a few notes you 
should be privy to:

- X11 is the windowing library for Linux machines - it operates as a server, and your program the client
- It must be added to the _linker_, hence the `#cgo LDFlAGS: -lX11` directive
- The linker is a part of the C compilation pipeline
- The first line of the file is a comment that restricts _this_ file to _only_ build on Linux environments
- Go will ignore the file entirely if the target architecture is not _Linux_, unless configured otherwise 

If you would like to do the same on a Windows machine, the call is a little simpler -

    //go:build windows
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #include <windows.h>
    
    void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        POINT p;
        GetCursorPos(&p);
        *x = p.x;
        *y = p.y;
    }
    */
    import "C"

And, on Darwin -

    //go:build darwin
    
    package host
    
    /*
    #include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>
    
    void GetMouseCoordinates(int *x, int *y) {
        CGPoint point = CGEventGetLocation(kCGEventNull);
        *x = (int)point.x;
        *y = (int)point.y;
    }
    */
    import "C"

### Calling the function
To call the above functions is also quite straightforward using the `C` package - but the name you type
must match the name in the C comment _exactly,_ as you'll likely lose type-ahead from your IDE at this point.

    func GetMouseCoordinates() (x int, y int) {
        var cX, cY C.int
        C.GetMouseCoordinates(&cX, &cY)
        return int(cX), int(cY)
    }

However, as you probably noticed - `int` and `C.Int` are not the same type.  Not only that, the parameters
are _passed by reference_ rather than returned.  These are just a few of the idiosyncrasies that come with
interoping between C and Go.  The next is critical to ensuring _graceful_ calls to a C function - handling
panics -

    import "fmt"
    
    func (m mouse) GetCoordinates() (x int, y int, err error) {
        defer func() {
            if r := recover(); r != nil {
                err = fmt.Errorf("failed to get mouse position: %v", r)
            }
        }()
    
        var cX, cY C.int
        C.GetMouseCoordinates(&cX, &cY)
        return int(cX), int(cY), nil
    }

As we are crossing the border from safe operation into other libraries, it is best to guard the entry
and exit points whenever possible with _recovery_ operations.  Please bear with me - I'm learning
how to write cross-language code right along side of you.

**NOTE:** This particular step includes a local _host_ package you can use to poke around with cross-language compilation. 

### Mouse Antics
I mentioned at the start of this that you'd be able to tell if the mouse moved _too fast_ using some simple math, however
this particular enigma is focused around _accessing_ host devices.  As such, if you would like to see how to do these
kinds of reactionary analyses you should jump back to the enigma on temporal analysis - specifically `E1S4` =)
