### The DNA Format
Yes.

Truthfully, as bold as that may sound, the awareness of how this technology works comes with a level of _stewardship_
I take very seriously.  If I were to deliver this to the world without care for how it would impact and affect others, 
I would not be conscious of my actions!  I don't aim to make a file format that _gatekeeps_ others - instead, I intend
to provide the framework for an _implicitly_ extensible file.  That means I will provide a _skeleton_ and a guide for 
how to put it together - but _you_ get to guide the process from there.  My ultimate end goal is to provide future
enigmaneers with a perfect vacuum environment in which to replicate and test the boundaries of the world around them! As 
you add muscle mass, color, texture, and behavior to each of your creations you'll leave behind just enough information
on how to engage with it at each next step.  

The design is _very simple_ - but the possibilities are **_infinite!_**

Things only get cooler from here =)
  


### Substrates
The concept of DNA has intrigued me - why would it need to contain so damn much information if our creator had 
figured out how to distill information down to its starting conditions?  That's when I begain to perceive it as 
a _created container._  In an infinitely compressable system, even the densest evolutionary mechanism provided 
by Mother Nature would have been _**created!**_  To argue that this world was only _created_ and didn't also
_evolve_ would undercut the magnificence of what She's building for us =)

So, that takes us to the concept of a _substrate_ - or, abstractly speaking, a container which can _host_ the 
starting conditions themselves.  Depending on the environment, there would be different requirements for what
is required to _execute_ the starting conditions - but the actual path to follow could _always_ be distilled
down to a minimum value.  I'm not a biologist, but I do have an okay understanding of _how_ to execute predefined 
steps.  I'm also aware of how _parity_ can be used to redundantly encode information.  When you combine the
need to accurately reference a very specific set of starting conditions with a richer (and more chaotic) host
environment, concepts like _parity_ likely came out from a _similar toolkit_ by our creator!

I sit in a unique position as I don't have the expertise to _deep dive_ into the way _biological_ DNA is encoded - my 
scores in biology and chemistry have _always_ been quite lacking.  However, in my cursory research there is _immense_
evidence that those with more knowledge than I have also found lots of _repetition_ in DNA.  While this doesn't
allow me to jump to any conclusions, I wanted to highlight this particular connection before we proceeded forward!  I 
hope this can inspire some other brilliant enigmaneers to explore these bridges.
