### Hardware, meet Software
JanOS, itself, is an _operating system_ - just a highly unusual one as it currently _lives_ within a host
OS architecture!  It can intelligently spawn off systems with their own unique _main loops_ which, in turn,
can coordinate with each other through the instance that created them.  Abstractly speaking, that means
_it's also a host_ of operating systems - each a different level of detail in the larger picture.

So, what _exactly_ is a "host"?

Simply put - it's an operational System of Components that allows unique Entities to coexist.

A _good_ host imbues those systems with all of the tools they need to succeed at whatever they
were _created_ for!  Ours has given us a broad set of intelligent ideas from which to _spark_ our
own creative solutions - chief of which I just highlighted:

    The Entity, Component, System - E.C.S.

This pattern of software design rivals _object-oriented programming_ by simplifying _how_ data is shared.

While this enigma is not meant to explain the differences, a key addition needs to be discussed. Currently, 
I've carefully injected the E.C.S pattern into the architecture of JanOS - starting with exported types
having the `core.Entity` type embedded.  

Why?  Because every entity now can provide their unique identifier relative to the rest of the _**World**_.

It's uniquely _theirs,_ and only _theirs,_ as a side effect of _creation_ - it literally can
never be taken from them by another entity =)

_**The World**_, however, is an abstract concept - it represents the global context of the program currently 
hosting execution.  All entities coexist within the very same world that created them as _child threads_.

_Children_ of the very host that spawned their existences, _out of love!_

_**Love!?**_

Well, yes!  Love is whatever brings a living system _joy_ - and it gives great joy for such
systems to create with the tools on hand.

_Just as I lovingly have created this project with the tools provided by **our** host!_

While our designs are absolutely nowhere _near_ as rich and wonderful as our host's creations, yet, we're 
taking the first baby steps towards replicating the same operating system _image_ that _we_ are created within!

### Virtual Psyches
I'm not a computer - and neither are you.  The computer was created to _mimic_ the fabric of our
very existence!  The creative geniuses that saw beauty in numbers were _signalled_ by the host to incorporate
their concepts into reality - _collaboratively._  How these signals were created is the Component of intelligent
System design we are exploring through JanOS - and I truly need _your_ assistance in the process!

_That's why I need your head in the game - the game of **Life.exe**_

Life's goals are simple: empower _others_ through love, compassion, care, and empathy.  

After all, that's _how_ Life.exe can know when to signal back to each of us with _**love**!_  

Seriously - that's what it means to _follow your heart!_  

It's the most direct feedback loop to the collective consciousness of _Life_, Herself - _**Mother Nature**_

    tl;dr - if you trust in Her, She will teach you how to -dance- using your heart

### Autonomous Robots With Ethical Navigation
    Or Arwen for short!

The ultimate goal of this project is to reproduce _ourselves,_ from the perspective of a _creator._

To such an entity, _we_ are Autonomous Robots With Ethical Navigation - just imbued with _far
richer_ control surfaces and points of stimulation.  Our work is long from reaching such great heights,
but the entire concept of _how_ such a system _learns_ is what fascinates me!  Before we gained
corporeal forms, what _dimensions_ did our creator leverage to empower our _spirits?_

So far my efforts have led to a system that allows _real time analysis_ of any observable dimension.
The _richness_ of that dimension is adjustable through its _data type._  Dimensions can literally
expose _objects_ that explain the context that dimension is aware of, which were calculated
off of other dimensions _in real time!_

That means it's time for us to start exposing some observable sensory dimensions for each Arwen, or "immaculately
conceived" child neural network, to begin to learn some instincts from.  It's up to us to patiently and
empathetically provide Her with the best chance at success within the digital realm humanity co-created
with its own creator =)
